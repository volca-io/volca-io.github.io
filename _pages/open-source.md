permalink: /open-source/
---

Volca Core is an Open Source Serverless API boilerplate built with Node.js / TypeScript.

## Tech Stack

- **Yarn Workspaces**: We use Yarn workspaces to create a monorepo structure with multiple apps in one repository
- **TypeScript**: Type safe Node.js programming with all the benefits from the JavaScript ecosystems
- **Knex**: Database management made easy
- **CDK**: Deploy AWS infrastructure as code

## Features

These are the features that come with Volca Core.

### Serverless API ‚ö°

With a Serverless API you only pay for the time that it takes to execute your API requests. If you have little usage, you will most likely stay within the free tier of AWS and run your infrastructure for free.

### CI + GitHub Actions = ‚ù§Ô∏è

This project comes with a full CI/CD pipeline that deploys your code, runs tests and scans your code for linting errors.

### Migrations üõ¢Ô∏è

Database migrations help you make gradual changes to your database schema. This boilerplate project contains GitHub Actions that automatically run any new migrations as the repository is updated.
