## Overview

What we want to achieve with this tutorial is to host and serve a HTML based web application. For that, we will need the following resources:

- An S3 bucket for file hosting
- A CloudFront distribution for CDN
- A Route 53 managed hosted zone for our custom domain
- An ACM managed SSL certificate to enable HTTPS with our custom domain

This article explains each resource that needs to be created and how they fit together. The full source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/volca-io/webapp-cdk).

## Defining the stack

Let's start with defining the stack that all of our resources will reside:

```
import { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

interface WebappStackProps extends StackProps {
  domain: string;
}

export class WebappStack extends Stack {

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: WebappStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
  }
}

```

This will create an empty stack. Next, let's define the resources we need to host a web application.

## Bucket and origin access identity

The below code creates a bucket that will hold the HTML and asset files that make up the web application.

```
const bucket = new Bucket(this, 'WebappHostingBucket', {
  websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',
  websiteErrorDocument: 'index.html',
  blockPublicAccess: new BlockPublicAccess({ restrictPublicBuckets: false }),
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
  autoDeleteObjects: true,
});
```

The below code creates an origin access identity (OAI) that allows the CloudFront CDN to access the S3 bucket and serve the files inside it.

```
const oai = new OriginAccessIdentity(this, 'WebappCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity');
bucket.grantRead(oai.grantPrincipal);
```

## Hosted zone and certificate

The below code creates a hosted zone that holds the domain that we want to use for our web application

```
const hostedZone = new HostedZone(this, 'HostedZone', { zoneName: props.domain });
```

Let's add the Route 53 name servers for our domain as outputs to the stack. Once the stack is deployed, you need to point your domain to these name servers.

```
if (hostedZone.hostedZoneNameServers) {
  new CfnOutput(this, 'NameServers', { value: Fn.join(', ', hostedZone.hostedZoneNameServers) });
}
```

Next, let's create an ACM managed certificate that allows us to enable HTTPS for the web application

```
const certificate: DnsValidatedCertificate | null = new DnsValidatedCertificate(this, 'Certificate', {
  domainName: props.domain,
  subjectAlternativeNames: [props.domain, `www.${props.domain}`],
  validation: CertificateValidation.fromDns(hostedZone),
  region: 'us-east-1',
  hostedZone: hostedZone,
  cleanupRoute53Records: true,
});
```

## CloudFront distribution (CDN)

The below code creates a CloudFront distribution that acts as a CDN for our web application. The CloudFront distribution points to our S3 bucket as an origin and uses our ACM certificate.

```
  const distribution = new CloudFrontWebDistribution(this, 'WebappDistribution', {
    viewerCertificate: ViewerCertificate.fromAcmCertificate(certificate, {
      aliases: [props.domain, `www.${props.domain}`],
      securityPolicy: SecurityPolicyProtocol.TLS_V1_2_2021,
      sslMethod: SSLMethod.SNI,
    }),
    originConfigs: [
      {
        s3OriginSource: {
          s3BucketSource: bucket,
          originAccessIdentity: oai,
        },
        behaviors: [{ isDefaultBehavior: true }],
      },
    ],
    errorConfigurations: [
      {
        errorCode: 404,
        errorCachingMinTtl: 300,
        responseCode: 200,
        responsePagePath: '/index.html',
      },
    ],
  });

  bucket.grantRead(oai.grantPrincipal);
```

## A-record

Finally, an A-record is created in our hosted zone that points the domain to the CloudFront distribution that serves our web application

```
  new ARecord(this, 'WebappARecord', {
    target: RecordTarget.fromAlias(new CloudFrontTarget(distribution)),
    zone: hostedZone,
    recordName: `${props.domain}`,
  });
```

Now we have defined all of the resources required to host our web application!

## Deploy

Follow the below steps to deploy the stack:

- Run `yarn`
- Add your configuration to `config.json` - leave `nsConfigured` as `false`
- Run `yarn deploy`
- Wait for the stack to be deployed
- Configure the name servers of your domain with the name servers in the stack output from the AWS console
- Wait for the change to propagate
- Update `config.json` with `"nsConfigured": true`
- Run `yarn deploy`
- Done! ðŸŽ‰
