## The Dream

Ever since the first unicorn tech companies started turning billions of dollars in profit and employing thousands of engineers, the number of software engineering employees with a dream to one day start their own company has been increasing rapidly. According to [Stack Overflows developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018), 25% of developers hope to be working as a founder or a co-founder of their own company in five years.

The reasons why developers like you want to start their own companies are many. Some of the most common reasons are:

### Money

Of course, one of the biggest reasons for starting a company is to be able to make a lot of money. While the average developer salary is higher than for many other professions, it rarely reaches the life changing levels that building a successful company can reach. Instead of trading time for money, you can use your skills to build a product and trade the value that the product brings your customers for money. If the product turns a profit and shows growth potential, there any many investors and other software companies who are looking for potential acquisitions. Note though that statistics say that most companies do not survive even their first year. Making a lot of money from starting a company is something that requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

### Freedom

Not having to go to an office or showing up to the daily standup call every day is something many developers dream about. Being able to have full control over your time can be good for your productivity as well. Some days you might be extremely productive and some days you might be stuck battling some issue. Or you get nothing done because of a day full of mandatory meetings. With your own company, you work when you feel like it.

### Passion

Working as an employee means, in most cases, that you will be building what someone else wants you to build. There is always a CEO, a Product Manager or an Engineering Manager setting the goals for the team. Starting your own company means that you can build a product that you are truly passionate about instead of building someone elses vision.

### Technology

In the end, developers love to build software. And they usually strong opinions and ideas on how great software should be built. Starting a business means full control over the technology stack used and the founders can be part of every technical decision made.

## The Path
